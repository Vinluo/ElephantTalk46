  <p>
    Elephanttalk46 is a long-term notebook for building visual systems that feel tactile and
    cinematic. The focus is on front-end experiments that mix static publishing with lightweight
    shaders, small interaction cues, and disciplined typography.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every entry is treated like a transmission: clear signal, low noise. That means prototype-first
    workflows, small design tokens, and repeatable patterns that make future posts easier to ship.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are mapping a similar path, start with a structure that keeps content and visuals
    decoupled. Build the pipeline, then let the atmosphere grow over time.
