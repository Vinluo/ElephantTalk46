Long-term publishing needs structure. Astro content collections give you a reliable schema for
metadata while keeping Markdown at the center of the workflow.

## Collections

Define the shape of your posts once and reuse it everywhere. The schema powers tags, categories,
and featured flags without extra boilerplate.

## Templates

Build a single post layout and reuse it for every entry. The design tokens do the heavy lifting,
so you only touch the copy each time you publish.

## Distribution

Use RSS and a sitemap to keep the archive discoverable. With a static host like GitHub Pages, the
entire pipeline stays lightweight and deploys in minutes.
